MFLAB README  (Heemstede, Netherlands, 8 Dec 2015)

mfLab ("Modflow Laboratory") is a n open-source scripting envioronment in Matlab
(not open source) to set up, run and analyze groundwater flow and transport models of
the suite MODFLOW (different versions), MODPATH, MT3DMS and SEAWAT (all open source).

mfLab runs on Macs and Windows and is developed on MacBook.pro.

mfLab requires Matlab (the Mathworks(c)).

mfLab has been available as open-source groundwater modeling environment since 2008 with
1088 commits (updates) during its development between 2008 and 2015. It has been available
on http://code.google.com/p/mflab and has been successfully used in many groundwater
modelling projects evern since; all my MSc and PhD students used it for the grounwater
models when preparing their theses, and further my colleagues in Waternet (www.waternet.nl)
as well as a number of people worldwide, to solve small and big groundwater problems.

It was also often used for small models, cross sections axially symmetric and flat for
demonstration purposes as well as in courses; many example simulation movies can be found
on YouTube (search for "groundwater" and "olsthoorn" of "mflab").

Most intensively it has been used for solving of groundwater problems that are affected by
density flow cased by varying salinities as well as temperature, which also includes the
effects of viscosity. You'll find that most examples are under the SEAWAT directory. Notice
that also examples are provided that simulate fresh and saline groundwater flow using the
SWI (salt water intrusion package, which is now include in the MF2005 code).

Because Google stopped supporting their code.google.com site in 2015, the project had to
be moved to github. As there were many problems with this movement, I had to establish a
clean version of the most recent files and create a new mfLab repository on Github.
Therefore, the current Github repository does not contain the the subversion history that
was available in te googlecode reposiotory, hense a new history will be built up from
December 8 2015 on Github.

The repository also contains documentation and tutorials.
