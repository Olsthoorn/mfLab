%% Generic steady state MODFLOW model with transport using MT3DMS

%% Explanation
%
% This model mimics the example given by Konikow (2011), fig 3.
% This model simulates a pollution in a groundwater field with a fair
% hydraulic gradient. Konikow uses it to show differences in outcomes
% caused by different solver methods.
% The model is single layer, 4.5 km wide and 5.4 km long with uniform cells
% of 100x100 m. Flow is from a high-level lake in the north along some
% obstacles to a river in the south. A pollution is simulated by means of
% two injection wells.

% we have a tracer and temprature. The retardation of temperature is about
